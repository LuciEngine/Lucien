## I'm in trouble.

I used different math library with the mesh loader. I shouldn't do that. The models are being translated back and forth, which means a lot of copying, casting, and I shouldn't do that. The raster uses different numeric types with my builtin data structures because I ported it from another project, I shouldn't do that. In one day they shall all union as a simple thing, but not today.
